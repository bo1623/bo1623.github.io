We're finally here! Learning React was fun and it was obvious from the start how React and JSX simplified the job of programmers in creating quicker and more interactive webpages. 

Then came along Redux.... and I was left thinking "Why are we even learning this abominable coding style, with so much boilerplate code (e.g. mapDispatchToProps, mapStateToProps, reducers, etc.), and the introduction of new concepts such as a global store and a Redux state, it was a lot to take in.

Life seemed much simpler when it was just about creating a local state in a React component and passing down those attributes as props to the component's children.

But as I started working on my final project, it all slowly came to me how Redux was making my life easier. Here are some stats - my app had: 

* 5 stateless components
* 7 container components
* 10 action creators
* 9 reducers

Now you might be thinking, to what purpose would I need these components and action creators? So let's dive into some of my app features:

[insert features here]

If I had told myself at the beginning of the project that my app would have this many features, I would've scoffed at the thought "how would I be able to accomplish such a monumental task in less than a week?". These were made possible with all the components, actions and reducers above, which in turn were made possible by Redux, so turns out Dan Abramov did indeed have our best interests at heart!
